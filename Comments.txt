README: good job!
Compilation: Why are there so many warnings? They seem also easy to solve..
Scalability: works! Nice use of Isend and Irecv!

Code is not working with only one core: why?

Why there is no test folder with the scalability script?

Results shouldnt be commented in the main file, but in a separate txt file...

Why you need this line? This is weird:
  #define DB(value) static_cast<double>(value)

just define h somewhere and use it: next you will do something like i*h.
